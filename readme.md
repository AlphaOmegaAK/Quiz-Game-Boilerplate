# A Trivia Style Quiz Game


## Reasoning of Existence
Wanted to not only practice some concepts that I dove deeper into, such as color theory and css properties that adjust the colors, but also there is a collab Trivia Project I would like to continue with the group. Felt like this would be a good fresh gust of air to reawaken the project. So I created this boilerplate for a function quiz game.
